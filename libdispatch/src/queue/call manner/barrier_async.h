/*!
 * @functiongroup Dispatch Barrier API
 * The dispatch barrier API is a mechanism for submitting barrier blocks to a
 * dispatch queue, analogous to the dispatch_async()/dispatch_sync() API.
 
 * It enables the implementation of efficient reader/writer schemes.
 
 * Barrier blocks only behave specially when submitted to queues created with
 * the DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT attribute; on such a queue, a barrier block
 * will not run until all blocks submitted to the queue earlier have completed,
 * and any blocks submitted to the queue after a barrier block will not run
 * until the barrier block has completed.
 
 * When submitted to a a global queue or to a queue not created with the
 * DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT attribute, barrier blocks behave identically to
 * blocks submitted with the dispatch_async()/dispatch_sync() API.

/*!
 * @function dispatch_barrier_async
 *
 * @abstract
 * Submits a barrier block for asynchronous execution on a dispatch queue.
 *
 * @discussion
 * Submits a block to a dispatch queue like dispatch_async(), but marks that
 * block as a barrier (relevant only on DISPATCH_QUEUE_CONCURRENT queues).
 *
 * See dispatch_async() for details.
 *
 * @param queue
 * The target dispatch queue to which the block is submitted.
 * The system will hold a reference on the target queue until the block
 * has finished.
 * The result of passing NULL in this parameter is undefined.
 *
 * @param block
 * The block to submit to the target dispatch queue. This function performs
 * Block_copy() and Block_release() on behalf of callers.
 * The result of passing NULL in this parameter is undefined.

 * @function dispatch_async
 *
 * @abstract
 * Submits a block for asynchronous execution on a dispatch queue.
 *
 * @discussion
 * The dispatch_async() function is the fundamental mechanism for submitting
 * blocks to a dispatch queue.
 *
 * Calls to dispatch_async() always return immediately after the block has
 * been submitted, and never wait for the block to be invoked.
 *
 * The target queue determines whether the block will be invoked serially or
 * concurrently with respect to other blocks submitted to that same queue.
 * Serial queues are processed concurrently with respect to each other.
 *
 * @param queue
 * The target dispatch queue to which the block is submitted.
 * The system will hold a reference on the target queue until the block
 * has finished.
 * The result of passing NULL in this parameter is undefined.
 *
 * @param block
 * The block to submit to the target dispatch queue. This function performs
 * Block_copy() and Block_release() on behalf of callers.
 * The result of passing NULL in this parameter is undefined.

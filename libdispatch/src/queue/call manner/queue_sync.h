 * @function dispatch_sync
 *
 * @abstract
 * Submits a block for synchronous execution on a dispatch queue.
 *
 * @discussion
 * Submits a block to a dispatch queue like dispatch_async(), however
 * dispatch_sync() will not return until the block has finished.
 *
 * Calls to dispatch_sync() targeting the current queue will result
 * in dead-lock. Use of dispatch_sync() is also subject to the same
 * multi-party dead-lock problems that may result from the use of a mutex.
 * Use of dispatch_async() is preferred.
 *
 * Unlike dispatch_async(), no retain is performed on the target queue. Because
 * calls to this function are synchronous, the dispatch_sync() "borrows" the
 * reference of the caller.
 *
 * As an optimization, dispatch_sync() invokes the block on the current
 * thread when possible.
 *
 * @param queue
 * The target dispatch queue to which the block is submitted.
 * The result of passing NULL in this parameter is undefined.
 *
 * @param block
 * The block to be invoked on the target dispatch queue.
 * The result of passing NULL in this parameter is undefined.
